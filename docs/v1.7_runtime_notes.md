# v1.7 Runtime Notes (Day6)

## Render runtime notes
- CPU: Edge TTS is CPU-bound; small instances may be slow.
- Dependency: `edge-tts` must be installed for `tts=true`.
- R2 env vars required for upload:
  - `R2_ENDPOINT`
  - `R2_BUCKET_NAME`
  - `R2_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `R2_SECRET_KEY`

## Common failures and fixes
- **edge_tts_failed**: `edge-tts` missing or text empty. Install dependency and verify `subs/my.srt`.
- **r2_upload_failed**: R2 env vars missing or invalid. Recheck secrets and endpoint.
- **pack_failed**: filesystem write error or zip failure. Check disk permissions.

## Rollback strategy
- Revert `release/v1.7` to the last known good commit.
- Disable v1.7 routes at the router include if needed.
